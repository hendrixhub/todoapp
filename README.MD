# My Code Louisville FSJS Project

This is a web application for the Code Louisville Full Stack JavaScript project requirement.  This is an application that demonstrates the ability to create, read, update, delete, and list data. During the edit operation there is a checkbox to indicate if the todo is complete.  This triggers a boolean true flag when complete in the database.  Future enhancements would include striking through the text upon saving the completed todo state.

It utilizes MongoDB, Express, jQuery, HandlebarsJS, Node and Bootstrap.
